**DFWaypoints** is a client-sided mod for the **DiamondFire** minecraft server. It aims to assist plot developers and builders in moving around their plots, as well as keeping track of their code/builds.

## Features
- **/waypoint** - The command used to create and teleport to waypoints. You can also use **/wp**.
- **/waypoint create <name>** - The command to create a waypoint. This waypoint will be set to your current location and registered for the plot you are currently on.
- **/waypoint delete <name>** - This command will delete the given waypoint from your saved data. This __cannot__ be undone!
- **/waypoint teleport <name>** - This command will teleport you to the given waypoint's saved location.
- **/wtp** - Acts as a shorter alias for **/waypoint teleport**.
- **/waypoint list** - This command will give you a list of all waypoints on your current plot, as well as a button to delete and teleport to them.
