**DFWaypoints** is a client-sided mod for the **DiamondFire** minecraft server. It aims to assist plot developers and builders in moving around their plots, as well as keeping track of their code/builds.

## Features
- **/waypoint** - The command used to configure waypoints. You can also use **/wp**.
    - **/waypoint create <name>** - Creates a waypoint at your current location.
    - **/waypoint delete <waypoint>** - Deletes the given waypoint.
    - **/waypoint teleport <waypoint>** - Teleports to the given waypoint.
        - **/wtp <waypoint>** - ```/waypoint teleport``` alternative.
    - **/waypoint list** - Lists all waypoints on your current plot.
    - **/waypoint appearance <option> <value> <waypoint>** - Sets the given waypoint's appearance option to the given value.
        - You can also modify these options by opening the config while on a plot.
- **Waypoint Rendering** - Waypoints are rendered in the world at their set positions.
    - Each waypoint can be configured to appear differently from others.
- **Lookwarp** - Teleport to waypoints just by looking at them and pressing a keybind!
